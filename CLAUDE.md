## CRITICAL NOTE ON SOURCES

### The Saga Problem

This is the single most important methodological issue for Viking Age research. **Icelandic sagas were written down in the 13th–14th centuries, describing events of the 9th–11th centuries.** The temporal gap is 200–400 years.

**Sagas are literary works, not history.** They contain historical kernels — real people, real places, plausible social dynamics — but they are:
- Shaped by the literary conventions of 13th-century Iceland
- Influenced by Continental romance traditions
- Written in a Christian intellectual context about a pagan past
- Composed for entertainment and ideological purposes (often to legitimize 13th-century Icelandic families)
- Not reliable for specific events, dialogue, or chronology of the Viking Age itself

**Every entry in this database must clearly distinguish:**

| Source Type | Description | Reliability |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Contemporary external** | Frankish annals (Annales Regni Francorum, Annales Bertiniani), Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Arabic accounts (Ibn Fadlan, Ibn Rustah, al-Mas'udi), Byzantine sources (De Administrando Imperio) | Highest for events they describe; subject to their own biases (monastic, imperial, cultural) |
| **Contemporary Scandinavian** | Runestones, skaldic verse (when attributable to a named skald of the period), archaeological evidence | High — direct evidence from Norse culture; runestones are terse, skaldic verse has strict meter that resists alteration |
| **Near-contemporary** | Adam of Bremen (~1070s), Ari Thorgilsson's Islendingabok (~1130) | Good — within 1-2 generations of late Viking Age events |
| **Saga literature** | Icelandic family sagas, kings' sagas (Heimskringla), legendary sagas | Literary works with historical kernels; **not reliable for specific events**; valuable for social customs, material culture, attitudes |
| **Eddic/mythological** | Poetic Edda, Prose Edda | Primary sources for mythology and cosmology; recorded in 13th century from older oral tradition |
| **Archaeological** | Ship burials (Oseberg, Gokstad), Birka graves, Hedeby excavations, L'Anse aux Meadows, ring fortresses | Highest reliability for material culture; interpretation can be debated |

### Handling Legendary Figures

Several major "Viking" figures exist primarily or entirely in saga tradition:
- **Ragnar Lothbrok (ON: Ragnarr Lodbrok):** Almost certainly legendary composite; no contemporary source confirms his existence as a single historical person
- **Lagertha (ON: Hlagerda):** Known only from Saxo Grammaticus (c. 1200); legendary
- **Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, Bjorn Ironside:** Saga tradition figures; may have historical kernels
- **Jomsvikings:** Legendary warrior brotherhood; the Jomsviking Saga is not historically reliable

These figures must be tagged **[Saga Tradition]** or **[Legendary]** and their entries must lead with their source status.

## Content Standards

### Academic Quality

- All entries should meet academic research standards
- Cite primary and secondary sources
- Include confidence assessments for all claims
- Note scholarly debates and uncertainties
- **Always** distinguish between contemporary evidence and saga tradition
- Acknowledge the fundamental source problem of Viking Age history
- Note when archaeological evidence confirms, contradicts, or is silent on literary accounts

### Confidence Levels

| Level | Tag | Definition |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Established | `[Established]` | Multiple independent contemporary sources; strong archaeological support |
| Probable | `[Probable]` | Single reliable contemporary source, or scholarly consensus from converging evidence |
| Debated | `[Debated]` | Scholarly disagreement; multiple interpretations; evidence is ambiguous |
| Speculative | `[Speculative]` | Hypothesis based on limited or indirect evidence |
| Saga Tradition | `[Saga Tradition]` | Known primarily or exclusively from saga literature; may contain historical kernels but not verifiable |

### "For Fiction Writing" Sections

These sections ARE appropriate as they serve any fiction writer:
- Sensory details (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch)
- Character notes (personality archetypes, social dynamics)
- Scene-setting information (landscapes, buildings, ships, weather)
- Dialogue opportunities (Old Norse terms, kennings, modes of address)
- Period-appropriate cultural details (clothing, food, weapons, rituals)
- **Saga Tradition material** is explicitly valuable for fiction even when not historically reliable — note this clearly
- These should be **generic** guidance, not tied to specific fictional works

### Cross-Referencing

- Use Obsidian wiki-links: `[[filename]]`
- Maintain consistent linking between entries
- Index files should provide navigation
- Note connections to Russian_History (Varangians/Rus), European_History (Normandy, British Isles), Byzantium (Varangian Guard)

## Naming Conventions

### File Prefixes

| Prefix | Content Type | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `HF-` | Historical Figure | HF-Harald-Fairhair.md |
| `BC-` | Battle/Campaign | BC-Stamford-Bridge-1066.md |
| `GE-` | Geography/Location | GE-Hedeby.md |
| `DY-` | Dynasty/Polity | DY-Fairhair-Dynasty.md |
| `TL-` | Timeline | TL-00-Master-Timeline.md |
| `RE-` | Religion/Mythology | RE-Odin.md |
| `EV-` | Event | EV-Settlement-of-Iceland.md |
| `PS-` | Primary Source | PS-Ibn-Fadlan-Risala.md |
| `SK-` | Skald/Literary Figure | SK-Egill-Skallagrimsson.md |

### Old Norse Name Conventions

- **Use standard anglicized forms** where widely established: Ragnar (not Ragnarr), Erik (not Eirikr), Leif (not Leifr), Olaf (not Olafr)
- **Provide Old Norse form** on first mention in each document: "Harald Fairhair (ON: Haraldr harfagri)"
- **Use ON form** for figures without common anglicized names: Ketill Flatnose (ON: Ketill flatnefr)
- **Patronymics:** Explain system on first use — "Leif Erikson (ON: Leifr Eiriksson, 'son of Erik')"
- **Women's names:** Note -dottir patronymic — "Freydis Eriksdottir (ON: Freydis Eiriksdottir, 'daughter of Erik')"
- **Place names:** Use anglicized primary with ON in parentheses — "Constantinople (ON: Miklagard)"

### Year Notation

- Use CE notation consistently
- Note approximate dates with "c." (circa)
- Many Viking Age dates are approximate — note uncertainty
- Saga-derived dates are especially uncertain — flag as `[Saga Tradition]`
