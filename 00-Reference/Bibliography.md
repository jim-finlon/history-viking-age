# Bibliography
## Viking Age / Norse World Academic Research Database

*Primary and secondary sources for Viking Age research (~550-1100 CE)*

---

## How to Use This Bibliography

This bibliography organizes sources by:
1. **Type:** Primary vs. secondary sources
2. **Category:** Thematic focus
3. **Reliability:** Source assessment notes

**Citation Format:** Modified Chicago style for accessibility

**CRITICAL NOTE:** The distinction between primary and secondary sources is unusually important for Viking Age studies. Most primary sources are either (a) external observers writing about the Norse, or (b) Scandinavian literary works written centuries after the events they describe. See [[CLAUDE]] for detailed source methodology.

## Part II: Primary Sources -- Scandinavian

*These are sources produced within Scandinavian culture. Runestones and skaldic verse are contemporary; saga literature is written down centuries later.*

### Runestones

**Date:** ~800-1100 CE (majority from 10th-11th century Sweden)
**Language:** Old Norse (runic script -- primarily Younger Futhark)
**Count:** ~3,000 known inscriptions (mostly Sweden; ~250 in Denmark; ~50 in Norway)

**Key reference works:**
- Sawyer, Birgit. *The Viking-Age Rune-Stones: Custom and Commemoration in Early Medieval Scandinavia*. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000.
- Scandinavian Runic Text Database (Samnordisk runtextdatabas) -- online resource

**Reliability Notes:**
- **Contemporary Norse voice** -- carved during the Viking Age itself
- Terse: typically commemorate the dead, record bridge-building, or note journeys
- Some reference specific campaigns (e.g., "He died in the east with Ingvar" -- Ingvar stones, referring to a Caspian expedition)
- High reliability for the information they contain; limited in scope
- The Jelling stones (Harald Bluetooth, ~965) are among the most important

### Skaldic Poetry

**Date:** Composed 9th-11th century; transmitted through later saga texts
**Language:** Old Norse
**Form:** Highly structured verse with strict meter (drottkvatt) and kennings (metaphorical compounds)

**Key reference works:**
- Clunies Ross, Margaret, et al., eds. *Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages*. Turnhout: Brepols, 2007-ongoing. (Definitive scholarly edition)
- Turville-Petre, E.O.G. *Scaldic Poetry*. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1976.
- Frank, Roberta. *Old Norse Court Poetry: The Drottkvatt Stanza*. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1978.

**Reliability Notes:**
- Composed contemporaneously by named skalds at the courts of kings
- The strict meter (especially drottkvatt) **resists later alteration** -- changes break the rhythm and alliteration
- However, transmitted through 13th-century saga texts; some corruption possible
- Scholars generally accept that the core text of attributed skaldic verse is authentic
- Valuable for confirming (or contradicting) later saga narratives
- Difficult to understand without extensive training in Old Norse poetics

### Icelandic Literary Sources (Written 12th-14th Century)

#### Ari Thorgilsson -- Islendingabok (Book of Icelanders)
**Date:** ~1122-1133 CE
**Author:** Ari Thorgilsson the Learned (ON: Ari Thorgilsson inn frodi)
**Language:** Old Norse (Icelandic)

**Best Translation:**
- Groenke, Sibylle, trans. *Islendingabok / The Book of the Icelanders*. Available in various editions and online.

**Reliability Notes:**
- **The most reliable Icelandic historical text**
- Written ~150 years after the events of the settlement; Ari names his informants
- Terse, factual style; notably restrained compared to saga literature
- Key source for Iceland's settlement, Christianization (1000 CE), and early political structure
- Near-contemporary for the Christianization narrative

#### Landnamabok (Book of Settlements)
**Date:** Earliest version ~1100s; surviving versions 13th-14th century
**Language:** Old Norse (Icelandic)
**Content:** Names ~400 original settlers of Iceland and their land claims

**Best Translation:**
- Palsson, Hermann, and Paul Edwards, trans. *The Book of Settlements: Landnamabok*. Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Press, 1972.

**Reliability Notes:**
- Compiles earlier sources, some now lost
- Settlement details may be reliable in broad outline; specific claims are family traditions
- Useful for patterns of settlement and social structure
- Later versions were expanded and edited; compare versions carefully

**Date:** ~1230 CE
**Author:** Snorri Sturluson (1179-1241), Icelandic chieftain, politician, and author

- Finlay, Alison, and Anthony Faulkes, trans. *Heimskringla*. 3 vols. London: Viking Society for Northern Research, 2011-2015.

**Reliability Notes:**
- **Not a history** despite its subject matter -- a literary work by a 13th-century Icelandic author
- Snorri used older skaldic verse as a framework, adding narrative prose
- The skaldic quotations are generally more reliable than Snorri's prose
- Invaluable for the tradition about Norwegian kings but must be used with extreme caution as historical evidence
- Snorri's Saga of St. Olaf is the fullest account of Olaf Haraldsson but reflects 13th-century concerns

- Byock, Jesse, trans. *The Prose Edda*. London: Penguin, 2005.

**Reliability Notes:**
- Primary source for the systematic presentation of Norse mythology
- Written by a Christian author interpreting pagan tradition; Snorri's framework shapes the material
- How much reflects genuine pre-Christian belief vs. Snorri's literary construction is [Debated]
- Essential reference, but use alongside the Poetic Edda and archaeological evidence

#### Poetic Edda (Elder Edda)
**Date:** Recorded ~1270 in the Codex Regius; poems themselves are older (estimated 9th-12th century)

- Voluspa (The Seeress's Prophecy) and Havamal (Sayings of the High One) are the most important
- Crucial for understanding the Norse worldview, even if the date and context of individual poems are [Debated]

### Icelandic Family Sagas (Islendingasogur)

*Beyond Heimskringla:*

#### Jomsviking Saga (Jomsvikinga saga)
**Date written:** ~1200
**Content:** Account of the legendary Jomsviking warrior brotherhood
**Reliability:** [Saga Tradition] -- Jomsborg has never been located; the saga is likely fictional with historical elements
**Fiction value:** Extremely high -- warrior brotherhood, strict code, dramatic battles (Hjorungavag)

#### Orkneyinga Saga
**Date written:** ~1200
**Content:** History of the Norse Earls of Orkney
**Best Translation:** Palsson, Hermann, and Paul Edwards, trans. *Orkneyinga Saga*. London: Penguin, 1978.

**Date:** ~1200 CE
**Author:** Saxo Grammaticus, Danish historian

**Reliability Notes:**
- Written in Latin, not Norse, reflecting clerical education
- Early books are legendary/mythological; later books more historical
- **Sole source for Lagertha** -- her historicity is [Legendary]
- Useful for Danish tradition but must be treated as a literary work
- Compare with Heimskringla for Norwegian perspective on overlapping events
