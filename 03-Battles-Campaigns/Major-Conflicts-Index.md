## How to Use This Index

Each entry includes:
- **Event name** and date
- **Location** and primary combatants
- **Source status** (contemporary documentation vs. saga tradition)
- **Outcome** and significance
- **Research status** ([E] Enumerated, [S] Stubbed, [X] Expanded, [V] Verified)

**NOTE:** Many Viking Age battles are known primarily from saga tradition. Battles marked [Saga Tradition] may not have occurred as described, or at all. Even [Established] battles may have saga-derived details grafted onto a confirmed historical event. See [[CLAUDE]] for full source methodology.

## I. Early Raids (793-850 CE)

*The first phase of Viking activity: hit-and-run raids on monasteries and coastal settlements, primarily targeting the British Isles and Frankish coast.*

| # | Event | Date | Location | Combatants | Source | Outcome | Res. |
|---|-------|------|----------|------------|--------|---------|------|
| 1 | **Raid on Lindisfarne** | June 8, 793 | Lindisfarne, Northumbria | Norse raiders vs. Lindisfarne monastery | [Established] -- ASC, Alcuin's letters, Northumbrian annals | Monastery sacked; monks killed or enslaved; symbolic start of the Viking Age | [E] |
| 2 | Raid on Portland | ~789 | Portland, Dorset | Norse (identified as "Danes") vs. local reeve | [Established] -- ASC. Often cited as the first recorded Viking contact in England; the local reeve tried to direct them to the king's town and was killed | [E] |
| 3 | Raid on Jarrow | 794 | Jarrow, Northumbria | Norse raiders vs. monastery | [Established] -- Northumbrian sources; less successful than Lindisfarne; some raiders killed | [E] |
| 4 | Raid on Iona | 795, 802, 806 | Iona, Scotland | Norse raiders vs. Columban monastery | [Established] -- Irish annals; repeated raids; 68 monks killed in 806; community eventually relocated to Kells | [E] |
| 5 | Raid on Aquitaine | 799 | Atlantic coast, Francia | Norse raiders vs. Frankish coast | [Probable] -- Frankish annals; early raiding on continental coast | [E] |
| 6 | Raids on Ireland | 795-830s | Various coastal sites | Norse raiders vs. Irish monasteries and settlements | [Established] -- Irish annals; escalating pattern of raids; monastery of Bangor raided 823; Armagh raided 832 | [E] |
| 7 | Raid on Dorestad | 834, 835, 836, 837 | Dorestad, Frisia | Norse raiders vs. major Frankish trading center | [Established] -- Annales Bertiniani; repeated attacks on one of the most important Carolingian commercial centers | [E] |
| 8 | Founding of Dublin | 841 | Dublin, Ireland | Norse establish longphort (ship camp) | [Established] -- Irish annals; transition from raiding to permanent settlement; Dublin becomes the major Norse center in Ireland | [E] |
| 9 | Raid on Nantes | 843 | Nantes, Francia | Norse raiders vs. cathedral city | [Established] -- Frankish sources; raiders attacked during a feast day, killing the bishop inside the cathedral | [E] |

**Notes on Early Raids:**
- The identity of the specific raiders is almost never known from contemporary sources
- The ASC and Frankish annals typically record "Northmen" (Normanni) or "Danes" (Dani) without individual names
- Monastic sources emphasize the sacrilegious nature of the attacks; the actual scale of early raids may have been smaller than the literary response suggests
- The question of "why" the Viking Age began when it did remains [Debated] -- overpopulation, political exile, trade opportunity, improved ship technology, and Carolingian wealth are all proposed factors

## II. Major Raids on Francia (845-892)

*Escalation from hit-and-run raids to large-scale campaigns on the Seine, Loire, and other Frankish waterways.*

| # | Event | Date | Location | Combatants | Source | Outcome | Res. |
|---|-------|------|----------|------------|--------|---------|------|
| 10 | **First Siege of Paris** | 845 | Paris, Francia | Norse army (led by "Ragnar" -- identity [Debated]) vs. Frankish defenders | [Established] -- Annales Bertiniani, other Frankish sources; attribution to "Ragnar Lothbrok" is [Saga Tradition] | Paris sacked; Charles the Bald paid 7,000 lbs of silver (first major Danegeld); a defining moment of Viking-Frankish relations | [E] |
| 11 | Norse raids on Iberia | 844 | Seville, Lisbon, and Atlantic coast | Norse fleet vs. Umayyad Andalusia and Christian Iberia | [Established] -- Arabic and Latin sources; the Norse sacked Seville but were defeated and driven out by the Umayyad emir | [E] |
| 12 | Mediterranean Expedition | ~859-862 | Iberia, Balearics, southern Francia, Italy | Norse fleet (attributed to Bjorn Ironside and Hastein in saga tradition) vs. various Mediterranean targets | [Probable] -- Frankish and Arabic sources confirm a Norse fleet in the Mediterranean; attribution to specific leaders is [Saga Tradition]; the fleet raided Algeciras, the Balearics, southern Francia (Narbonne area), and possibly Pisa/Luna | [E] |
| 13 | Loire Campaigns | 843-865 | Loire Valley, Francia | Norse warbands vs. Frankish territories | [Established] -- Frankish annals; the Loire became a semi-permanent Viking highway; Nantes, Tours, Angers, Orleans all attacked | [E] |
| 14 | **Second Siege of Paris** | 885-886 | Paris, Francia | Large Norse army (~700 ships claimed) under Sigfred and Sinric vs. Paris defenders under Count Odo | [Established] -- Abbo Cernuus wrote an eyewitness Latin poem (*Bella Parisiacae Urbis*); Annales Vedastini | Paris held; the siege lasted ~10 months; Emperor Charles the Fat eventually paid the Norse to leave; Count Odo's defense made him famous and eventually king | [E] |
| 15 | Raids on Flanders and Low Countries | 879-892 | Flanders, Lotharingia | Norse "Great Army" operating from continental bases | [Established] -- Annales Vedastini, Annales Fuldenses; after the Paris siege, this army ravaged northern Francia until defeated at Leuven (891) | [E] |

**Notes on Frankish Campaigns:**
- The Frankish annals are generally well-informed and contemporary; these campaigns are among the best-documented events of the Viking Age
- The Danegeld payments created a cycle: payment encouraged further raids
- Norse commanders in Frankish sources are rarely identifiable with saga figures; "Ragnar" in 845 is almost certainly not the Ragnar Lothbrok of saga tradition
- The distinction between "Danish" and "Norwegian" raiders is often unclear in Frankish sources

## III. The Great Heathen Army and England (865-954)

*The transformation from raiding to conquest. The Great Heathen Army (OE: mycel haethen here) invaded England in 865 and within a decade conquered three of the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.*

- The army's composition and leadership are partly [Saga Tradition] -- the ASC mentions "sons of Ragnar" but does not name Ragnar himself
- The identification of Ivar the Boneless (ASC: "Ivar") with Imar, king of Dublin Norse (Irish annals), is [Debated] but widely accepted
- The size of the army is [Debated]; estimates range from ~1,000 to ~3,000 warriors

## IV. Ireland and the Irish Sea (795-1014)

| # | Event | Date | Location | Combatants | Source | Outcome | Res. |
|---|-------|------|----------|------------|--------|---------|------|
| 25 | Norse-Irish Wars (general) | 795-950 | Ireland | Norse settlers vs. Irish kingdoms; Norse factions vs. each other | [Established] -- Irish annals; complex pattern of alliance and conflict; Norse and Irish frequently allied against other Norse and Irish | [E] |

**Notes on Ireland:**
- Norse Dublin persisted as a trading center long after Clontarf
- The Irish-Norse world was deeply intermarried by 1014; "Norse" and "Irish" identities were fluid
- The Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh ("War of the Irish with the Foreigners") is a later propagandistic text glorifying Brian Boru; use with caution

|---|-------|------|----------|------------|--------|---------|------|
| 27 | Harald Fairhair's Unification Battles | ~870s-880s | Western/southwestern Norway | Harald vs. petty kings | [Saga Tradition] -- primarily Heimskringla; the Battle of Hafrsfjord is the traditional climactic battle; skaldic verse supports Harald's existence but the narrative is literary | [E] |
| 28 | Battle of Hafrsfjord | ~872 (traditional) | Hafrsfjord, Rogaland, Norway | Harald Fairhair vs. coalition of regional kings | [Saga Tradition] -- the date, location, and significance are all primarily from Heimskringla; modern scholars [Debate] whether this was a single decisive battle or a later literary construction | [E] |

| 31 | Battle of Hjorungavag | ~986 | Location [Debated] -- western Norway? | Jomsvikings vs. Hakon Jarl of Norway | [Saga Tradition] -- Jomsviking Saga gives a detailed account; historicity of both the Jomsvikings and this specific battle is [Debated]; may have a historical kernel involving a real naval engagement | [E] |
