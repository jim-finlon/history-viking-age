## Handoff Notes for Next Session

### Recommended Starting Point
Begin with **Phase 1: Timeline Foundation**. The Master Timeline (TL-00) should be created first, establishing the chronological backbone. This timeline should:
- Cover ~550-1100 CE
- Clearly distinguish [Established] dates from [Saga Tradition] dates
- Include parallel events in England, Francia, Byzantium, and the Islamic world
- Note key archaeological dates (ship burials, site datings)

### Key Decisions Already Made
1. Following Russian_History project model (standalone academic database, fiction projects are consumers)
2. Confidence levels adapted from Russian_History but with added **[Saga Tradition]** level for the unique source problem
3. Old Norse names: anglicized primary, ON in parentheses on first mention
4. Saga literature treated as literary sources, not history -- but explicitly valuable for fiction sections
5. File prefixes: HF-, BC-, GE-, DY-, TL-, RE- (consistent with sibling projects)

### Critical Methodology Reminders
- **Always** distinguish contemporary from saga sources in every entry
- **Never** present saga narrative as historical fact without qualification
- **Do** note when archaeological evidence confirms saga claims (e.g., L'Anse aux Meadows confirms Vinland voyages)
- **Do** note when popular culture conflates legendary and historical (e.g., Ragnar Lothbrok)
- Skaldic verse deserves special treatment: composed contemporaneously, meter resists alteration, but transmitted through later saga texts

### Research Questions to Track
- [ ] What is the current scholarly consensus on Harald Fairhair's unification of Norway? (Downward revision of his actual territory)
- [ ] What does the Birka Bj 581 warrior grave study actually demonstrate? (Female warrior debate)
- [ ] What is the state of Jomsborg identification? (Still unlocated)
- [ ] How are the Trelleborg ring fortresses currently interpreted? (Military vs. administrative)
- [ ] What do isotope studies reveal about Viking mobility patterns?
- [ ] Status of new Vinland site identifications beyond L'Anse aux Meadows?
